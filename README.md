Hi this repository is for terraform practice.

Each folder have specific terraform configuration files which are first executed then pushed on this git repository and so do have their resources created with them 

to initiate a terraform script follow the following commands after writing the terraform script:

1. terraform init - to initiate terraform, this lets terraform install all the required plugins that would be used in creating desired resources
2. terraform plan - this command shows the terraform execution plan 
3. terraform apply - this command actually brings the execution into action and crestes the required resources
4. terraform destroy - this command is used to to destroy the created resources if they are not needed any more.
