Here when main.tf file is executed the resultant hello.txt is resouce is created.
This is a basic terraform script creating local resource.

*NOTE - after cloning this repository and trying to create the resource using main.tf and variable.tf the resource wouldn't be created as here in the repository I have already uploaded the resource created, so to run the terraform scripts and see the resource creation we need to delete all the files except the .tf configuration files and start with terraform init then terraform apply.*
