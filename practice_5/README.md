here in this I have tried implementing output resource, output resource is being used to display the output variables of the infrastructure.
to see the resultant output of the resources use command *terraform output*

*terraform show - it displays the tfstate file resource attributes for the infrastructure*

*NOTE - before going for terraform apply here do terraform destroy first to remove the resources already created*
